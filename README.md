# NiCoLpy

A lightweight clipboard manager for macOS. Copy multiple things, then pick which one to paste — right where your cursor is.

NiCoLpy lives in the menu bar, keeps a history of what you copy (text and images), and lets you paste any previous clip with a keystroke or a click.

## Features

- **Menu bar app** — unobtrusive, no Dock clutter
- **Global hotkey** — `⌘⇧V` opens the picker at your text insertion point (falls back to the mouse)
- **Text & image history** with automatic de-duplication
- **Keyboard-first picking**
  - `↑` / `↓` to navigate, `↩` to paste
  - `1`–`9` to paste a recent clip directly
  - `esc` to dismiss
- **Pinned favorites** — keep important clips from being cleared
- **Launch at login** — optional, via the modern `SMAppService` API
- **Right-click the menu bar icon** for Settings, Launch at Login, and Quit

## Installation

> **The easy way — one command.** Open the **Terminal** app (press `⌘ Space`,
> type *Terminal*, press `Return`), then copy-paste this line and press `Return`:
>
> ```bash
> curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vemsom/NiCoLpy/main/install.sh | bash
> ```
>
> It checks your Mac, installs what's needed, builds NiCoLpy, puts it in your
> Applications folder, and launches it. When it's done, look for the clipboard
> icon 📋 in your menu bar. The only thing left is to turn on Accessibility (see
> [Step 6](#step-6--allow-auto-paste-recommended)) so it can paste for you.

If you'd rather do it yourself, here's every step by hand.

## Installation by hand (step by step)

NiCoLpy isn't on the App Store — you build it once on your own Mac with a single
command, then drag it into your Applications folder. **No coding experience
needed.** Just follow these steps exactly. It takes about 5 minutes.

> **What you need:** a Mac running macOS 13 (Ventura) or newer. That's it.

### Step 1 — Open the Terminal app

The Terminal is an app that already comes with every Mac.

1. Press `⌘` (Command) and the `Space bar` at the same time. A search box appears
   in the middle of the screen.
2. Type **Terminal** and press `Return`.
3. A window with a blinking cursor opens. This is where you'll paste commands.

### Step 2 — Install Apple's developer tools (one-time)

NiCoLpy needs a small free toolkit from Apple to build. You probably don't have
it yet, so install it now. (If you already have it, the command just tells you so
— no harm done.)

Copy the line below, paste it into the Terminal window, and press `Return`:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

- A popup window appears asking to install the tools. Click **Install** and then
  **Agree**.
- Wait for it to finish (a few minutes). When it's done, the popup closes by
  itself.

> Already have Xcode or the tools installed? You'll see a message like
> *"command line tools are already installed"* — that's fine, move on.

### Step 3 — Download and build NiCoLpy

Copy this entire block, paste it into the Terminal, and press `Return`.
It downloads NiCoLpy and builds the app for you automatically:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads && \
git clone https://github.com/vemsom/NiCoLpy.git && \
cd NiCoLpy && \
./build-app.sh release
```

When it finishes (about a minute), you'll see a line that says **"Done."**
The finished app is now in `~/Downloads/NiCoLpy/build/`.

### Step 4 — Move the app to your Applications folder

Copy and paste this line, then press `Return`:

```bash
cp -R ~/Downloads/NiCoLpy/build/NiCoLpy.app /Applications/
```

NiCoLpy is now installed in your Applications folder, just like any other app.

### Step 5 — Open NiCoLpy for the first time

Because NiCoLpy is a free app (not sold through Apple), macOS asks you to confirm
the first time you open it. You only do this **once**.

1. Open your **Applications** folder (in Finder, press `⌘⇧A`).
2. **Right-click** (or hold `Control` and click) on **NiCoLpy**.
3. Choose **Open** from the menu.
4. A warning appears — click the **Open** button to confirm.

That's it! Look at the top-right of your screen: a small clipboard icon 📋 now
sits in your menu bar. NiCoLpy is running.

> From now on, NiCoLpy just opens normally — you never have to right-click again.

### Step 6 — Allow auto-paste (recommended)

So that picking a clip can paste it for you automatically, give NiCoLpy one
permission:

1. When NiCoLpy first runs, a box may pop up asking for **Accessibility** access —
   click **Open System Settings** and turn NiCoLpy **on**.
2. If you missed it: open **System Settings → Privacy & Security →
   Accessibility**, find **NiCoLpy** in the list, and switch it **on**.

Without this, NiCoLpy still copies the clip you pick — you just paste it yourself
with `⌘V`.

## How to use it

- **Copy things normally** with `⌘C`. NiCoLpy remembers them.
- Press **`⌘⇧V`** (Command-Shift-V) anywhere to open the list of what you've
  copied — it appears right next to your cursor.
- **Pick a clip:** click it, or press a number key (`1`–`9`), or use `↑`/`↓` and
  press `Return`. Press `esc` to close without pasting.
- **Right-click the 📋 menu bar icon** for Settings, Launch at Login, and Quit.

## Updating to a newer version

Open Terminal and paste:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads/NiCoLpy && \
git pull && \
./build-app.sh release && \
cp -R build/NiCoLpy.app /Applications/
```

(Quit NiCoLpy first by right-clicking the menu bar icon → Quit.)

## Uninstalling

Drag **NiCoLpy** from your Applications folder to the Trash. To also remove the
permission, open **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility** and
remove NiCoLpy from the list.

## For developers

```bash
./setup-signing.sh        # one-time: create a stable local signing identity
./build-app.sh            # debug build → build/NiCoLpy.app
./build-app.sh release    # optimized build
open build/NiCoLpy.app
```

**About signing & the Accessibility permission.** macOS ties Accessibility
permission to an app's code-signing identity. A plain ad-hoc signature changes
on every build, so the OS would forget the permission each time you rebuild or
update. `setup-signing.sh` creates a local, self-signed identity called
`NiCoLpy Local`; `build-app.sh` then signs with it so the identity stays
constant and you only grant Accessibility once. The one-line installer runs this
for you automatically. The certificate is local to your Mac and can be removed
any time from Keychain Access.

## How it works

- `ClipboardMonitor` polls `NSPasteboard` for changes. Text is always preferred
  over images, because macOS will otherwise render rich text (RTF/HTML) into an
  image — which would create false duplicates on every copy.
- `ClipStore` holds the history, handles de-duplication, the unpinned limit, and
  pinned ordering.
- `CaretLocator` uses the Accessibility API to find the caret position so the
  picker appears next to where you're typing.
- `PickerPanel` is a floating, non-activating `NSPanel` that takes keyboard
  focus without stealing activation from the app you're working in.
- `Paster` writes the selected clip to the pasteboard and synthesizes `⌘V`.
